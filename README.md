# capstone_project
This is my first capstone project

# Dataset source
I have taken data from Kaggle named "Emergency - 911" Calls I have imported the file using pandas.read_csv().

# Data modification
I have created some columns like 'Reason' and 'Hour' etc. in my file by extracting data from the already given columns.

# Outputs
I have outputs based on the questions given to me by my udemy instructor.
